** Compiling the wrapping samples **

It's strict ANSI C.  However, in `wrappers.h' conditionals are used
to determine the local line termination (CR, LF, or CRLF) of the
it's compiled for.  It is assumed that one of the following three
has been #defined (either by the compiler, or manually):

	* __macos__	for Mac OS systems (uses CR)
	* __unix__	for Unix systems (uses LF)
	* __win32__	for MS-DOS-type systems (uses CRLF)

With one of these set, the sources should compile cleanly on any
ANSI C compiler.


** Using the wrapping samples **

	* wrap-plain.c provides the NewQuotedText function
	* wrap-quoted.c provides the RewrapText function

These functions can be used from any caller.  Sample invocations
can be found in `main.c'; detailed descriptions of the function
APIs can be found in the sourcefiles.
